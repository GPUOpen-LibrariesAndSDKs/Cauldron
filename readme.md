# Cauldron

A simple framework for rapid prototyping on Vulkan or DirectX12.

Cauldron was developed by AMD and is used internally to develop prototypes, demos and SDK samples.

Cauldron is compiled as a static library. To see it in action check projects below.

# Build

## Prerequisites

- [CMake 3.16](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- [Windows 10 SDK 10.0.18362.0](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk)
- [Vulkan SDK 1.2.131.2](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/)

## How-to-Build

- Run the `GenerateSolutions.bat` file in the `build` directory.
- `build/VK` and `build/DX12` folders will contain the `Cauldron_*.sln` files
- Simply build the solution file for the desired API
- `build/DX12/src/DX12/` directory will contain the compiled static library `Framework_DX12.lib` for DX12 (similar for VK) under the selected configuration (Debug/Release) folder.

# Framework Architecture

Every feature in Cauldron has been implemented in a single file using C++11.

The main features could be grouped in 4 categories:

- **Resource managers & loaders**
  - Texture loaders - *can load `DDS`, `PNG`, `JPG` and any other file supported by the WIC subsystem. It can also create image views.*
  - StaticBufferPool - *holds vertices and indices for static geometry. It creates a huge buffer and then suballocates chunks from it in a linear fashion. Chunks cannot be freed.*
  - DynamicBufferRing - *holds constant buffers and also vertices and indices. Same as before but allocation happens in a ring fashion.*
  - ResourceViewHeaps - *holds the Descriptor Sets.*  
  - UploadHeap - *system memory buffer that holds the texture data to be uploaded to video memory via DMA*
  - CommandListRing - *allocates a number of command buffers from a ring buffer and returns a ready-to-use command buffer.*
  - Device - *all the device related code.*
- **Renderers**
  - GLTF* - *loads and renders the model using a certain technique*
  - PostProcPS/PS - *draws a 2D quad using a custom shader, used by the post processing passes.*
  - ImGUI - *code for driving the ImGUI*
  - Widgets
    - Wireframe - *draws a wireframe cube (used for rendering bounding boxes and light/camera frustums)*
    - Axis - *draws the coordinate axis of a matrix*
- **Vulkan specific helpers & setup code**
  - InstanceVK - *creates an instance and enables the validation layer*
  - Extension helpers 
    - ExtDebugMarkers - *sets up the debug markers*
    - ExtFp16 - *enables FP16 extension*
    - ExtFreeSync2 - *enables FreeSync extension*
    - ExtValidation - *enables the validation layer*
- **Commons & OS-specific code**
  - Swapchain - *handles resizing, fullscreen/windowed modes, etc.*
  - FrameworkWindows - *creates a window, processes windows message pump*

Cauldron was originally written using DX12 and later on ported to Vulkan using the same structure. This would make Cauldron ideal for learning Vulkan if you're coming from DirectX12, or vice versa.

# Known Issues

Please bear in mind that in order to keep Cauldron simple we are only covering the most frequently used features (for now). 

Please feel free to [open an issue](TODO:LinkToGitHubRepoIssuesPage) for bug reports.

# Contribution

Cauldron should be very easy to extend, should you want to contribute to Cauldron, you can [open a merge request](TODO:LinkToGitHubRepoMergeRequestPage).
